at the start where the variables are defined, total2 is written as total 2. This is wrong because variables cant take names with space in them.
output total1,total2 should be a rectangle not a paralellogram
they should be below each other output and end
 
As the program wants us to get 10 temperatures only, the is count <101 should be replaced with count < 11
